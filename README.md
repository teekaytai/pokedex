# Computer Vision Pok√©dex

We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of Pok√©mon from Generation 1. We experimented with various archietectures and hyperparameters, and used transfer learning to produce our final model. The model achieves an accuracy of 84.0% and a top-5 accuracy of 94.4%.

The dataset used was a combination of a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lantian773030/pokemonclassification/) as well as images collected from the [Pok√©mon Fandom Wikia website](https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Generation_I_Pok√©mon). The final dataset comprised of 13965 images from a variety of media, such as the mainline games, the anime, spinoff games, fanart, etc.

## Try it Yourself!

If you'd like to play around with our final model yourself, simply clone this repo and open up [test.ipynb](test.ipynb). Ensure that you have all the necessary Python libraries including Tensorflow and Keras installed. Add a filepath to an image you'd like to use in the last cell of the notebook and run the code to see what our model classifies your image as!
